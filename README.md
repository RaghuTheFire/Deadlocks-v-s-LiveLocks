# Deadlocks-vs-LiveLocks
Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, resulting in a circular wait where no thread can proceed. This situation leads to a complete system freeze, and the only resolution is to terminate one or more threads or break the circular wait condition.

In the provided code, we demonstrated a deadlock scenario using two threads and two resources (resource1 and resource2). Each thread locks one resource and then tries to lock the other. The steps are:

- Thread 1 locks resource1 and attempts to lock resource2.
- Simultaneously, Thread 2 locks resource2 and attempts to lock resource1.
- Both threads are now stuck, waiting for the other to release its lock, causing a deadlock.

Livelock occurs when two or more threads actively try to resolve a resource conflict, but their continuous attempts prevent progress. Unlike deadlock, threads in a livelock are not blocked; instead, they are actively retrying to access resources in a never-ending cycle.

In the livelock scenario, two threads attempt to lock resources (resource1 and resource2). However, each thread voluntarily releases its locked resource when it detects the other thread is trying to proceed. The steps are:

- Thread 1 locks resource1 and notices that Thread 2 is waiting for it. It releases resource1 and retries after a delay.
- Similarly, Thread 2 locks resource2, notices Thread 1 waiting, and releases resource2.
- Both threads enter a cycle of releasing and retrying, but neither can make progress.

Scenarios Where Deadlock and Livelock Occur

1. Distributed Systems
Deadlock: Nodes in a distributed system may wait indefinitely for each other to release resources (e.g., file locks or database records), causing a system freeze.
Livelock: Nodes may keep retrying requests for shared resources (e.g., message queues), leading to excessive contention and poor system throughput.

2. Resource Management in Cloud Computing
Deadlock: Multiple tasks or processes may lock shared resources, such as CPUs or memory, and wait for others to release them, resulting in a complete freeze.
Livelock: Resource requests are continuously retried due to high contention, causing delays and inefficient resource utilization.

3. Traffic Control Systems
Deadlock: Circular waits can occur when traffic signals are configured incorrectly, leading to vehicles being stuck indefinitely.
Livelock: Traffic signals may keep switching states to accommodate all directions but fail to allow any direction sufficient time to proceed, creating inefficiency without a complete freeze.
